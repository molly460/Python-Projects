#  Basic-Python-Projects
I started learning python few days ago and decided to work on some basic projects to help me understand the concept more better.
The idea behind this repo is to keep track of my progress while i continue my journey.Below is the description of the different projects.


## Projects :

- Basic Calculator:
 
     This calculator performs all of the arithmetic operations and actually allows the user to specify which operator to use.     
     The user enters a number, an operator and, finally the second number. clicks run and python perfoms the operation.
     This project basically explains the use of lists, if statements, floats and int(conversion of a str to an integer or decimal).


- Dictionary:

   Dictionary is a actually a little topic under python which is basically an unordered collection of items.
    Each item of a dictionary has a key/value pair.
    
  The idea is to build a little dictionary where the user enters a particular word which is a key in this case and in return gets the definition associated to that word.
   
  Although i am still thinking on how to implement that.
 From the code in my Dictionary.py file, the user can access the value by passing in the key in square bracketwhich is not what i want 
   ```
   print(Dictionary[Expression])
   ```
   
 - GuessingGame:
 
    The basic idea, is to specify a secret word inside our and the user can interact witht the program and try to guess the secret word
    till he/she gets the secret word right.
    The game emphasises more on variables, input statements, if/else statements and, while loops.
